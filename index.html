                distinguished Educators. The educators at

                of the our team are
                achievers in their own right as well as excellent teachers and mentors. Says one student, “Most of our
                educators are research scholars themselves and are deeply involved in their own subjects of interest.
                It is this attitude of our teachers and mentors that really makes them special, and engaging for our
                students. It
                becomes especially important to have educators who think in this way for our students to get their
                answers and take their involvement in their courses to the next level”.</p>
